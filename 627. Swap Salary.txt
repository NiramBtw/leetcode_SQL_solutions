# the sex 'key' is an enum m\f and need 2 swap them up
# any m->f 
# so any case of f = m any else will be f as well cuz its an enum 

#update Salary 
#set sex = case when sex = 'f' then 'm'
#              else 'f'
#                  end
# tyring to make it more efficiency              
#update salary 
#set sex = if(sex='m','f','m')
# a bit better can do much better
