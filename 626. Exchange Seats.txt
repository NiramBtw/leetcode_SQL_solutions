# first the id - is for the seats , so need to swap student only 
# because we have odd num so the last student  will stay same 
# 1. 1 will go to 2 and 2 will go to 1 
# 2. because its inside swaping im thinking if \ case when - on the id  
# 3. after swaping ids need to re register
# keep that 5 is a special case
# if(condition, what happend if true , what happend if false )
#
#select if(id % 2 =0 ,id -1 ,id + 1) as student 
#from seat 
# {"headers": ["student"], "values": [[2], [1], [4], [3], [6]]}
# now need to add the special case
#
# if(id < (select max(id) from seat) -> filter 
# if(id % 2 =0 ,id- 1 ,id+ 1) 
# if(id % 2 =0 ,id- 1 ,id) -> special case

#select if(id < (select max(id) from seat) , if(id % 2 =0 ,id- 1 ,id+ 1), if(id % 2 =0 ,id- 1 ,id)) as id, student from seat
#order by id 

# now try to work with case when 

select 
      case
        when id%2 = 0 then id-1
        when id%2 =1 and id <(select count(*) from seat) then id+1
        else id
       end as id,
    student
    
from seat
order by id
