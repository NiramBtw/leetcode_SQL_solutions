# giving the length 
# how to decide what is a triangle 
# my first thinking is that the longest line need to be
# longer then the other 2 lins + any 1 of them need to be more then half of the longest 1
# 
# fist need to find whats the long line using if 
#select x,y,z ,if (x+y > z and x+z > y and y+z > x ,'Yes','No') as triangle
#from triangle 

# using case when and not if 
select x, y, z, 
case when x+y > z and x+z > y and y+z > x then 'Yes'
    else 'No'
end as triangle
from triangle
