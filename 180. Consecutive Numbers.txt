# at least three times in a row
# join?, with 3 entrys 
#after that we need to work on the copy b=Logs that we make 
#then comper them by id looking on the nums 
# for the first run i got wrong - fixing by using distinct 
#
#select distinct a.Num as ConsecutiveNums
#from Logs as a
#join Logs as b 
#on a.Id = b.Id + 1 and a.Num = b.Num    # here we make 2 ent
#join Logs as c
#on a.Id = c.Id + 2 and a.Num = c.Num
# after solv trying to make it better 
# using left joins with same logic 

#select distinct a.Num as ConsecutiveNums
#from Logs a
#left join Logs b on a.id + 1 = b.id
#left join Logs c on b.id +1 = c.id
#where a.Num = b.Num
#and b.Num = c.Num

# making it beeter same logic using inner join
